                Things changed a lot when Audi acquired Lamborghini in 1998. The first thing Audi wanted to do was to relaunch a small Lambo, one that would beat Ferrari 360 Modena in performance as well as day-to-day usability, and turn Sant’Agata to a profitable operation. It did. Thanks to strong financial and engineering backing, not to mention the quality control know-how and quality components supplied by its mother company, the Gallardo was incredibly well made for something rolled off Sant'Agata. Well, not that the whole production was carried out at Sant'Agata. Its aluminum spaceframe chassis was actually built in Neckarsulm of Germany, and its V10 engine was also designed and built by Audi.
